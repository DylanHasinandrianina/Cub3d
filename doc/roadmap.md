Of course\! This `cub3D` project is an exciting step up from `minishell`. It combines file parsing, graphics programming, and core game development concepts. It's a fantastic project to build on your C programming skills. Let's break it down into a manageable plan.

Here is a roadmap and some guidance to get you and your partner started on the right foot.

## Project Roadmap: A Two-Week Plan

This schedule assumes about 6-8 hours of work per day. Remember to communicate constantly with your partner. The key to success in a team project is integration.

### **Week 1: Foundations and Core Logic**

| Day | Student A (Parser) | Student B (Execution - You) | Daily Sync Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | **Setup & Theory:** Set up the Git repo. Create the `Makefile` with basic rules (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`). Start reading about parsing strategies for `.cub` files. | **Setup & Ray-casting Theory:** Clone the MiniLibX library. Get a basic window to open and close. Start learning the fundamentals of Ray-casting. Don't code it yet, just understand the DDA algorithm and how vectors and planes work. | Agree on the `Makefile` structure and the location of the `libft` and `minilibx` directories. |
| **Day 2** | **Parsing Identifiers:** Write functions to read the `.cub` file line by line. Parse the texture paths (`NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA`) and the floor/ceiling colors (`F`, `C`). Store this information in a temporary structure. | **Window & Pixels:** Learn how to draw a pixel on the screen using `mlx_pixel_put()`. Create functions to draw vertical lines and basic shapes (like a filled rectangle for the floor and ceiling). | Define the main data structure (`t_game` or similar) that will hold all parsed information and game state. |
| **Day 3** | **Data Structure Finalization:** Implement the logic to validate and store the parsed texture and color data into the final, agreed-upon data structure. Start thinking about how to read the map part. | **Player Movement (No Walls):** Implement player movement (W, A, S, D) and rotation (left/right arrows). The player will just be a set of coordinates (`x`, `y`) and an angle (`angle` or `direction_vector`). | Finalize the data structure. The parser needs to know exactly where to put the data, and the execution part needs to know where to get it from. |
| **Day 4** | **Map Reading:** Read the map grid from the file into a 2D array (`char**`). Handle spaces and basic validation (e.g., only allowed characters). | **Basic Ray-casting:** Implement a single ray. Cast it from the player's position and find the first wall it hits. For now, just print the distance to the wall. | Discuss how the map will be stored (`char**`) and how the player's starting position (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`) will be extracted and stored. |
| **Day 5** | **Map Validation (Part 1):** Implement the logic to check if the map contains only valid characters (`0`, `1`, `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, and space). Ensure there is exactly one starting position. | **Visualizing the Rays:** Cast a ray for every column of the screen. Based on the distance, draw a vertical line. Shorter distances should result in taller lines. You should see a basic 3D representation now\! | **Integration Day 1:** Combine the parser and the execution. The main function should call the parser, get the data structure, and then pass it to your graphics engine. |
| **Day 6** | **Map Validation (Part 2):** Implement the "closed map" check. This is tricky. A common method is a flood-fill algorithm starting from the player's position. If the flood-fill touches any "edge" of the map array that isn't a '1', the map is not closed. | **Adding Colors:** Implement the floor and ceiling colors from the parsed data. Draw the ceiling on the top half of the screen and the floor on the bottom half before drawing the walls. | Review the map validation logic together. Make sure it's robust. |
| **Day 7** | **Error Handling & Cleanup:** Refine all error messages. Make sure every `malloc` has a `free`. The parsing module should be robust and clean. | **Texture Mapping (Part 1):** Load the texture files (`.xpm`) using MiniLibX. Write the logic to determine which wall face was hit (North, South, East, or West) based on the ray's angle and intersection point. | Define how texture data will be managed. How do you link a texture to a wall face? |

### **Week 2: Texturing, Refinement, and Bonuses**

| Day | Student A (Parser) | Student B (Execution - You) | Daily Sync Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 8** | **Code Review & Refinement:** Review all parsing code. Add comments, check for norm errors, and write test `.cub` files with various errors to ensure your program exits gracefully. | **Texture Mapping (Part 2):** Calculate which column of the texture to use for the vertical line you are drawing. This involves some math based on exactly where the ray hit the wall. Apply the textures. | **Integration Day 2:** A full integration test. The program should now be able to take a valid `.cub` file and display a fully textured maze you can move in. |
| **Day 9** | **Supporting Bonus Features:** If you decide to do bonuses, you may need to adjust the parser (e.g., to handle door characters in the map or sprite locations). | **Wall Collisions:** Implement collision detection. Before moving the player, check if their new position will be inside a wall. If so, prevent the move. | Discuss how to implement bonuses. What new information is needed from the parser? |
| **Day 10**| **Bonus Work / Final Polish:** Continue supporting bonus features or thoroughly test the mandatory part. | **Minimap (Bonus):** This is a great bonus to start with. Draw a 2D grid on the screen representing the map, and a dot for the player. | Decide which bonuses to tackle and in what order. |
| **Day 11**| **Documentation:** Write clear comments and documentation for the parsing logic. | **Mouse Look (Bonus):** Implement camera rotation based on mouse movement instead of just the arrow keys. | Review the bonus features' implementation progress. |
| **Day 12**| **Final Testing:** Create a suite of valid and invalid maps to test the entire program. | **Final Testing & Refinement:** Hunt for bugs. Is the movement smooth? Are textures correct on all sides? Does `ESC` and the red cross work perfectly? No memory leaks\! | Conduct a full project code review together. Check for the norm, memory leaks (`leaks --atExit -- ./cub3D map.cub`), and overall code quality. |
| **Day 13**| **Project Cleanup & Submission Prep:** Final review of the `Makefile`, all source files, and ensure the project conforms to all submission requirements. | **Project Cleanup & Submission Prep:** Same as Student A. Ensure all parts are polished and ready for submission. | Do a final run-through of the project together, from compilation to execution, as if you were the evaluator. |
| **Day 14**| **Buffer/Practice Day:** Use this day to fix any last-minute bugs, practice your presentation, or get a head start on another project\! | **Buffer/Practice Day:** Same as Student A. You've earned a bit of a buffer. | Celebrate a completed project\! |

## Your Questions Answered

### **Where the heck do I even start from?**

You start with the simplest possible thing: **getting a window to appear on your screen and then close.**

1.  **Get MiniLibX:** Clone or download the library.
2.  **Write a `main.c`:** In it, use `mlx_init()`, `mlx_new_window()`, and `mlx_loop()`.
3.  **Compile:** Link against the MiniLibX library and the required frameworks (`-L/path/to/minilibx -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit`). Your `Makefile` will handle this.
4.  **Handle Events:** Make the `ESC` key and the window's red cross close the window cleanly using `mlx_key_hook`, `mlx_hook`, and `exit()`.

Once you can do that, you've overcome the first major hurdle and have a canvas to draw on.

### **What kind of concepts should I learn beforehand?**

Focus your initial learning on these areas:

  * **Ray-casting:** This is the core of the project. Don't just copy code. Understand *why* it works. Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorials (especially the Ray-casting section) is a legendary resource for this. You need to understand:
      * **Vectors and trigonometry:** How to represent player position and direction.
      * **DDA Algorithm (Digital Differential Analysis):** A fast algorithm for traversing a grid, which is perfect for finding wall intersections.
      * **Fish-eye effect:** Understand why it happens and how to correct it.
  * **The MiniLibX Library:** Read its documentation or look at examples. You need to be comfortable with:
      * Initializing the library and creating windows.
      * Handling events (keyboard and mouse).
      * Drawing pixels and working with images (`.xpm` files).
  * **C Data Structures:** You'll be passing a lot of data between the parser and the graphics engine. A well-organized `struct` is essential.

### **What kind of stuff should I discuss with my partner before coding?**

Clear communication here will prevent major headaches later. Before writing a single line of project code, sit down and agree on:

1.  **The Main Data Structure:** This is the most critical point. Define a single `struct` (`t_game_data`, for example) that will contain *everything*: the MLX pointers, the parsed map (`char**`), texture paths, ceiling/floor colors, player position, player direction, etc. This `struct` is the contract between the parser and the graphics engine.
2.  **The Module Interface:** How will `main` call the parser? The parser should be a single function that takes `argc` and `argv`, and returns a pointer to the fully validated `t_game_data` struct, or `NULL` if there's an error.
3.  **Error Handling Strategy:** When the parser finds an error, how does it signal it? Agree on a single error-reporting function. The subject says to print `"Error\n"` followed by a message. A function like `void exit_with_error(char *message, t_game_data *data)` that frees allocated memory before exiting is a good idea.
4.  **Coding Norms:** You're both familiar with the 42 Norm, but re-confirm your approach to variable naming, file organization, etc., to keep the project consistent.

### **How to structure the project to have the best chance of completion?**

A clean directory structure makes life much easier. Here is a battle-tested layout:

```
.
├── Makefile
├── cub3D_bonus.c        # Main file for bonus part
├── cub3D.c              # Main file for mandatory part
├── includes/
│   ├── cub3d_bonus.h
│   └── cub3d.h          # Main header with your t_game_data struct
├── libft/                 # Your libft library source files
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── ...
├── minilibx/              # MiniLibX source files (if you use them)
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── ...
├── parsing/
│   ├── parser.c
│   ├── map_validation.c
│   └── ...              # Files related to parsing and validation
├── execution/
│   ├── player_movement.c
│   ├── raycasting.c
│   ├── rendering.c
│   └── ...              # Files related to graphics, hooks, and game logic
└── maps/
    ├── valid_map.cub
    └── error_map.cub    # Test maps
```

**Why this structure works:**

  * **Separation of Concerns:** The parser code is completely separate from the execution code. This allows you to work independently. Student A can work in `/parsing` and you can work in `/execution`.
  * **Shared Header:** The `includes/cub3d.h` acts as the central point of truth. It defines the data structures that both parts of the program will use.
  * **Clean Makefile:** Your main `Makefile` will `cd` into `libft/` to compile it, then compile the `.c` files from the `parsing/` and `execution/` directories to create the final `cub3D` executable.

Stick to this plan, communicate openly with your partner, and you'll be in a great position to not only complete this project but to create something you're proud of. Good luck\!
